# Allan Baltazar Baby Shower

This was the website used to announce the baby shower of my second child, my son Allan Baltazar.<br/>
The website invited friends and family to be part of our happy moment.<br/>
The website also allows visitors to interact with our family by sending us a message.<br/>
There is an admin page which requires my authentication info to sign in to read, approve or delete messages.<br/>
It is available both english and portuguese languages so people from Brazil may also be able to read it.
